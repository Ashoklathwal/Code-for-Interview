* Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
* One Away: There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
  remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
  one edit (or zero edits) away.   
* Given a string "aaabbbcc", compress it into "a3b3c2" in-place.[**Original Question**](https://www.careercup.com/question?id=7449675)    [**Solution**](stringCompression.java)

* Write a function that parses a string into integer.[**Solution**](parseStrToInteger.java)

### Bitwise Manipulation

* Count set bits in an integer
* Insertion: You are given two 32-bit numbers, Nand M, and two bit positions, i and j. Write a method to insert Minto N such that M       starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011,   you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not     fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
  EXAMPLE
   Input: N = 10001001100,M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
   Output: N = 10001001100

  EXAMPLE
   Input: 1775 (or: 11011101111)
   Output: 8
* Next Number: Given a positive integer, print the next smallest and the next largest number that have the same number of 1 bits in       their binary representation.
* Debugger: Explain what the following code does: ( (n & (n -1) ) == 0) .
* Conversion: Write a function to determine the number of bits you would need to flip to convert integer A to integer B.
* Pairwise Swap: Write a program to swap odd and even bits in an integer with as few instructions as possible (e.g., bit 13 and bit 1     are swapped, bit 2 and bit 3 are swapped, and so on). 
* Draw Line: A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive pixels to be stored in one byte. The     screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can     be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2 J y) .
  The method signature should look something like:
   drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
