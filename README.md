You can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if M = 10011,   you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not     fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2. [**Solution**](More%20Codes/updateBits.java)

   Output: 8

The     screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can     be derived from the length of the array and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2 J y) .
  The method signature should look something like:
   drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)

* Code a function that calculates the square root (2-point precision) of a given number(wihtout using the Math library). Follow up: Avoid redundant calculations by now optimizing your function with a caching mechanism. [**Babylonian method/Newton's method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Babylonian_method) [**Solution**](square_root.java) [**Explanation**](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-a-perfect-square/) 
* Write a function that raises one number to another number, i.e. the pow() function in log(n) time. [**Solution**](pow.java)
* Implement integer division without using / or % in O(logN).
* given an array A[], and a rule array R[], A[] has some numbers... R[] has numbers from 0 to sizeof(A[])-1 (ie R[] has indices of A[] in shuffled order). So, by just looking at R[] and A[], you need to tell after how many rounds we will get original A[] if we apply R[] to it. ex. A[]={1,2,3} R[]={2,0,1} then answer should be 3

* How would you use Python to read a very large tab-delimited file of numbers to count the frequency of each number?
* Write a function that takes a sentence and prints out the same sentence with each word backwards in O(n) time.
* Write a function that takes an array, splits the array into every possible set of two arrays, and prints out the max differences between the two array’s minima in O(n) time.
* You have a room-full of balances and weights. Each balance weighs ten pounds and is considered perfectly balanced when the sum of       weights on its left and right sides are exactly the same. You have placed some weights on some of the balances, and you have placed     some of the balances on other balances. Given a description of how the balances are arranged and how much additional weight is on each   balance, determine how to add weight to the balances so that they are all perfectly balanced.
